## Project Motivation

**KJ Orbital** is a desktop-based scientific visualization and simulation project inspired by the orbital mechanics research of **Katherine Johnson**. Her work laid the mathematical foundation for satellite trajectories, orbital geometry, and atmospheric flight analysis during the early space program.

While these papers are mathematically rigorous, they are inherently static.  
The motivation behind KJ Orbital is to translate these equations into **interactive simulations**, allowing users to explore how orbital parameters evolve and interact in real time. The project aims to make historically significant aerospace research more accessible through modern computational tools.
